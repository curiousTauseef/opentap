# What is OpenTap?

OpenTap is a software defined networking interface to network tap devices. Network tap devices are devices that can capture data plane traffic in a network. This data can be collected in various formats such as pcap (packet capture) or NetFlow (flow records in CSV). OpenTap configuration is set by an administrator through the opentap.conf file.
The OpenTap interface is a remote invocation service that can be implemented on top of other protocols such as SSH or HTTP (via REST API). 

# How do I install OpenTap?

OpenTap depends on Python3, please install Python3 first and be sure "python3" is in your path. If the Python3 installation does not create an executable called "python3", creating a soft link called "python3" that links to the executable name using "ln -s". Be sure to also install pip3; creating a soft link called "pip3" if necessary.

Once Python3 is properly installed, execute the installation script:
sudo bash install.sh

You must use bash to execute the install script. Some Linux distributions use dash; dash will not properly execute the script.

The installation script will install the necessary files for OpenTap, try to resolve dependencies (e.g., Python libraries, Phidgets driver), and then solicit input from you to setup operating parameters and observation point identifiers. Observation point identifiers uniquely identify a data observation point such as a specific network interface or a specific Phidgets sensor. The user selects the identifiers such that they have a significant meaning in the application.

OpenTap will be installed in the /opt/opentap directory. All data collected by OpenTap during its operation will be stored in /opt/opentap/log.
OpenTap consists of two perpetually executing programs (a python script Web server that hosts the REST API, and a bash script Garbage collector 
that purges old data).

Starting OpenTap:
sudo /opt/opentap/bin/start_opentap.sh

Shutting down OpenTap:
sudo /opt/opentap/bin/stop_opentap.sh

# How do I use OpenTap?

The quickest way to use OpenTap is with the OpenTap Python module found in demo/opentap.py along with the demo script demo/opentapdemo.py. The opentap.py module contains functions to initiate data capture tasks and retrieve the data into PANDAS data frames. At the top of this file (opentap.py) you will want to create a Python dictionary for each of your OpenTap devices. The dictionary will need a name and contain three fields (name – the name of the device, ipaddr – the IP address of the OpenTap device REST API, and portnum – the port number of the OpenTap device REST API). Here is an example for our OpenTap device that is monitoring our Virgo cluster:
VIRGO = { 'name': 'virgo', 'ipaddr': '129.108.40.76', 'portnum': '50080' }

The demo script (opentapdemo.py) shows an example of how to capture NetFlow data and retrieve this data into a PANDAS data frame.

# OpenTap's API

OpenTap supports three functions: capture, retrieve, and capabilities

**capture**
arguments: type start stop observationpt type – data type
start – start time of capture
stop – stop time of capture
observationpt – observation point identifier (0 for default)
return: id (used for retrieval)
REST: /capture/type?start=xx&stop=xx&observationpt=xx

**retrieve**
arguments: id
id – retrieval id (returned from capture invocation)
return: captured data REST: /retrieve?id=xx

**capabilities**
arguments: none
return: supported data type list, observation point identifier list, capture length limit, retention period limit
REST: / or /capabilities

Data types currently supported: Network data types: netflow, ethernet Sensor data types: Phidgets temperature, Phidgets motion, Phidgets vibration

Observation points:
Each OpenTap device can support multiple observation points for each data type. The OpenTap device administrator can associate meaningful IDs with 
system specific IDs for the data collection devices (network interface card identifiers, Phidgets sensor identifiers). This is setup in an opentap.conf 
file found in /etc/opentap. The installer will solicit input to auto-generate this file.
